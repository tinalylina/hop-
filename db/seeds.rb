# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
	Expert.create(name: "Tina", description: "I love Budapest", location: "budapest", interests: "[sangria, pinot noir]", startDate: 11/01/2015, endDate: 11/05/2015)
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
